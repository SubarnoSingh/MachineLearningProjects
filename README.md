# 🧠 Machine Learning Projects for Learning

Welcome to my collection of basic and beginner-friendly Machine Learning projects! This repository is a learning journal where I experiment with various ML algorithms and datasets while building my foundational understanding.

> 🚀 These projects are not meant to be production-ready, but rather to demonstrate core ML concepts in action.
